# Trademark Takedown Policy

## Overview

McpMux respects the intellectual property rights of trademark holders. If you
believe that a server listing in this registry infringes on your trademark,
please follow the process below.

## How to Submit a Takedown Request

### Option 1: GitHub Issue

Open an issue in this repository with the title **"Trademark Takedown Request: [Brand Name]"**
and include the information listed under [Required Information](#required-information).

### Option 2: Email

Send an email to **legal@mcpmux.com** with the subject line
**"Trademark Takedown Request"** and include the information listed below.

## Required Information

Please provide the following in your request:

1. **Your name and contact information**
2. **Company or organization you represent**
3. **The trademark(s) at issue** (registration number if applicable)
4. **The specific server listing(s)** that you believe infringe your trademark
   (include the server ID or link to the listing)
5. **Description of the concern** — explain how the listing infringes your
   trademark (e.g., unauthorized use of logo, false claim of official status,
   misleading endorsement language)
6. **Requested action** — what you would like McpMux to do (e.g., remove the
   icon, change the name, remove the listing entirely)
7. **A statement** that you are the trademark owner or authorized to act on
   their behalf

## What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment** — We will acknowledge receipt of your request within
   **2 business days**
2. **Evaluation** — We will review the claim and verify that you are the
   trademark owner or authorized representative
3. **Action** — If the claim is valid, we will remove or modify the offending
   listing within **48 hours** of completing our evaluation
4. **Notification** — We will notify the original contributor of the action
   taken and the reason
5. **Resolution** — We will confirm the resolution with the complainant

## Scope

This policy covers:

- Unauthorized use of trademark logos or brand imagery in server icons
- False claims of official status or endorsement
- Server names or descriptions that imply affiliation where none exists
- Any other trademark misuse in server definitions

## Good Faith

McpMux operates this registry in good faith as a community resource. Server
definitions are contributed by community members, not by McpMux. We do not
verify the trademark compliance of every submission but act promptly on valid
complaints.

## Counter-Notice

If your listing was removed or modified and you believe the takedown was in
error, you may submit a counter-notice explaining why you believe your use is
lawful (e.g., nominative fair use, authorized use). We will evaluate
counter-notices on a case-by-case basis.
